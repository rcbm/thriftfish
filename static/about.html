  <font class="Headline">Hi,</font><br>
My name is Roger Cosseboom, and I'm a student at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. I'm creating this site as a webapp that allows users to save their search keywords and price ranges for used items on  websites such as Craigslist, Amazon, Ebay, and more. Then, when an item matching their criteria is posted, users are automatically notified of the fresh listings.  
<br><br>Currently, it only searches Craigslist.org, but I am hard at work finishing features and expanding. In the future I hope to have it searching other sites, storing time and price information ala Kayak.com, and providing item comparisons and recommendations.
	  <br><br>For now, it is very rough, but the site is only 13 days old so be gentle :)
